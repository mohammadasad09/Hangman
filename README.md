# Hangman

This is a dynamic, command-line Hangman game written in Python. Players choose from three exciting categories: Movies, Geography, or Animals, and select from five levels of increasing difficulty: Easy, Medium, Difficult, Professional, and Impossible.

The game offers a unique and immersive experience by utilizing external files to store a vast collection of words for each category and difficulty level, ensuring fresh gameplay with every session.
